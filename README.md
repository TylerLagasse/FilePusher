# FilePusher
an application that pushes xml files from one directory to another

#Step 1: Configure the Config file  
You need to set your origin path, where the files live currently.  

Then set the destination path, where the files will go. Windows does not allow files to move across drives.  

#Step 2: Run the program  
You can push 1, 100, 500, or a custom amount. Even if there's less than the amount you're attempting to push, it will push the max amount it can.  

That's pretty much it! It only supports .XML right now because that's what I needed.
